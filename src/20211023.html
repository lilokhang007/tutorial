    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>Ammonia can be produced by a process called the Haber process.</p>
    <p>a) Write down the equation of Haber process. Specify any condition needed.</p>
    <p>b) i) What is activation energy?</p>
    <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;ii) Draw a energy profile for the Haber process, label the activation energy with and without catalyst.</p>
    <p>c) The graph below shows the amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen at different times, </p>
    <p>after mixing 1 mole each of the two gases in the container, until equilibrium has been reached. </p>
    <img src="20211023_a.png" width="55%">
    <p>Given that K<sub>c</sub> = 1.929 M<sup>2</sup>, calculate the volume of the container. </p>
    <p>d) If the volume of the container is gradually reduced to half, calculate the new equlibrium concentrations. </p>
    <p>Hence explain how the pressure condition of the Haber process favours the yield. </p>
