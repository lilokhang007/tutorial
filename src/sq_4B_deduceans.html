    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>A neutral carbon compound W has molecular formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p>On treatment with boiling sodium hydroxide solution followed by acidification, W gives an acid X (relative
    molecular mass = 122.0) and a neutral compound Y.</p>
    <p>Y can be oxidized with acidified potassium dichromate solution to another neutral compound Z. Z does not
    react with acidified potassium dichromate solution.</p>
    <p>Deduce the possible structures of W, X, Y and Z. Explain your reasoning.</p>
